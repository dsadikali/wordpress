== Description ==

WP Banner Admin allows you to manage various banner ads from different affiliate programs.
With the banner plugin you can manage:

* different banners from one affiliate program
* different banners from different affiliate programs
* your own banner campaigns limited by date or page impressions
* more than one capaign on the same blog

Needless to say that this plugin supports banner rotation. Every banner is randomly selected after each
page reloaded.
Because of using the Ajax-Technology, the banner clicks will stored asynchronously to the database.
This may be important for sites with high page impressions, because banner actions (loading and clicking) will not
affect page loading time.

With the new admin interface now its easier to place the banner on your WP-Theme.

The bannersize support is usefull for Flash banner, because of Flash is a
vector format, so the original Flash-banner could be much bigger than the size you want to use in your ad.

Pay attention if you are using the bannersize option with images. 
If your are not sure what size your banner image may have, leave the selection empty.
